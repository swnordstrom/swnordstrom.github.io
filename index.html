				<h1>Scott Nordstrom</h1>
                <h4>scottwatsonnordstrom&amp;gmail:com</h4>
        <p>I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/population-research/">Population Research Center</a> in the <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/urban-public-affairs/">College of Urban and Public Affairs</a> at Portland State University. Here, I mostly work on data science projects related to demography in metropolitan Portland and the state of Oregon.</p>
				<p>Previously, I worked primarily in ecology and evolutionary biology. I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the <a href="https://geog.ubc.ca/">Geography Department</a> at the University of British Columbia, advised by <a href="https://williamslabubc.weebly.com/">Jennifer Williams</a>. Prior to that, I obtained my PhD from the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/ebio/" target="_blank">Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Deartment</a> at the University of Colorado, Boulder, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/melbourne/">Brett Melbourne</a>. I was also a student in the <a href="http://iqbiology.colorado.edu" target="_blank">Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology</a> program.</p>
				<p>I am relatively new to human demography and quantitative social science. My interests in this field include domestic migration, political geography, and education.</p>
				<p>My ecology interests include population dynamics and demography (mostly in plants), life history theory, quantitative genetics, pollination biology, phenology, landscape ecology, microhabitat variation, and remote sensing.</p>
				<p>My math interests include networks and graph theory, probability and stochastic processes, applied linear algebra, and statistical modeling and analysis.</p>
