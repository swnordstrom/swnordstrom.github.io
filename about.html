		<h2>Current and ongoing Projects</h2>

		  <p>
		      <b>Flowering phenology and its influence on population dynamics</b>. For my postdoctoral work, I'm working with <a href="https://williamslabubc.weebly.com/">Jennifer Williams</a> to incorporate flowering phenology into integral projection models of the perennial forb <i>Lomatium utriculatum</i> in Garry oak savannas in British Columbia.
		  </p>

		<p>
		      <b>Demography in fragmented tallgrass prairie.</b> Together with a series of wonderful friends and collaborators at the <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/">Echinacea Project</a>, I am involved in a series of projects looking at demographic processes in fragmented pouplations of <i>Echinacea angustifolia</i> in western Minnesota. Read more about one of these projects below in <i>Prior projects</i>.
		</p>


		<h2>Prior projects</h2>
		
		
      
		  <p>
		      <b>Variation in light environment and timing of flowering</b>. Beginning in summer of 2020, I began monitoring individual plants of two species across a light gradient, recording timing of and investment in flowering. Future plans for this project include measuring environmental variables (e.g., soil moisture) and plant traits as well as some genomic work. I am doing this work at CU's <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/mrs/">Mountain Research Station</a> with help from several CU EBIO faculty.
		  </p>

		<p>
		      <b>Remote sensing and fine-scale environmental variation</b>. Together with fellow students <a href="https://annaspiers.weebly.com/">Anna Spiers</a> and <a href="https://matthewbitters.wordpress.com/">Matt Bitters</a>, I am helping to use remote sensing techniques to build fine-scale microclimate models at CU's <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/mrs/">Mountain Research Station</a>. These include models of solar radiation, soil moisture, and soil temperature, and include data collected using an <a href="https://www.envirodiy.org/">EnviroDIY Arduino-based</a> sensor network.
		      
		</p>
		
		<p>
		      <b>Population dynamics and rapid adaptation.</b> I have been collaborating with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/melbourne/">Brett Melbourne</a> at CU Boulder and <a href="http://www.hufbauerlab.org/">Ruth Hufbauer</a> at Colorado State University, among others, to study the ecology and evolution of populations experiencing rapid phenotypic change. Currently, I am incorporating the effects of longevity, overlapping generations, and age structure into models of phenotypic change. Prior work includes <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2023.1228">studying the joint effects of negative density dependence and genetic erosion on evolutionary rescue</a> and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.04.11.588938v2">longevity's effects on rescue.</a>
		  </p>

		<p>
		      <b>Effects of fire on population growth rates in a <i>Echinacea angustifolia</i></b>. I am constructing a matrix projection models for several populations of the narrow-leaved purple coneflower in Minnesota. In particular, I am quantifying the contributions of individual demographic rates (e.g., increased flowering, increased survival) to population-level responses to fire. I am doing this work with Stuart Wagenius (the <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/">Echinacea Project</a>) and <a href = "https://www.bethel.edu/academics/faculty/dykstra-amy"> Amy Dykstra</a> at Bethel University. This work was published in 2021 at <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-021-04955-2">Oecologia</a></em>.
