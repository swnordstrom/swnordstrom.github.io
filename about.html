		<h2>Current Projects</h2>
      <p>
		      <b>Population dynamics and rapid adaptation.</b> We are doing work combining stochastic demographic models with genetically explicit models to examine ecological and evolutionary dynamics of rapid adaptation. Current projects include looking at the effects of negative density dependence on evolutionary rescue and examining life history trade-offs in changing environments. We are testing some of these model predictions with <i>Tribolium</i> flour beetles in laboratory cultures. I am doing this work with <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/lab/melbourne/">Brett Melbourne</a> at CU Boulder and <a href="http://www.hufbauerlab.org/">Ruth Hufbauer</a> at Colorado State University.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		      <b>Variation in light environment and timing of flowering</b>. Beginning in summer of 2020, I began monitoring individual plants of two species across a light gradient, recording timing of and investment in flowering. Future plans for this project include measuring environmental variables (e.g., soil moisture) and plant traits as well as some genomic work. I am doing this work at CU's <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/mrs/">Mountain Research Station</a> with help from several CU EBIO faculty.
		  </p>

		<p>
		      <b>Remote sensing and fine-scale environmental variation</b>. Together with fellow students <a href="https://annaspiers.weebly.com/">Anna Spiers</a> and <a href="https://matthewbitters.wordpress.com/">Matt Bitters</a>, I am helping to use remote sensing techniques to build fine-scale microclimate models at CU's <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/mrs/">Mountain Research Station</a>. These include models of solar radiation, soil moisture, and soil temperature, and include data collected using an <a href="https://www.envirodiy.org/">EnviroDIY Arduino-based</a> sensor network.

		<p>
		      <b>Demography in fragmented tallgrass prairie.</b> Together with a series of wonderful friends and collaborators at the <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/">Echinacea Project</a>, I am involved in a series of projects looking at demographic processes in fragmented pouplations of <i>Echinacea angustifolia</i> in western Minnesota. Read more about one of these projects below in <i>Prior projects</i>.

		<h2>Prior projects</h2>
		
		<p>
		      <b>Effects of fire on population growth rates in a <i>Echinacea angustifolia</i></b>. I am constructing a matrix projection models for several populations of the narrow-leaved purple coneflower in Minnesota. In particular, I am quantifying the contributions of individual demographic rates (e.g., increased flowering, increased survival) to population-level responses to fire. I am doing this work with Stuart Wagenius (the <a href="http://echinaceaproject.org/">Echinacea Project</a>) and <a href = "https://www.bethel.edu/academics/faculty/dykstra-amy"> Amy Dykstra</a> at Bethel University. This work was published in 2021 at <em><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00442-021-04955-2">Oecologia</a></em>.
		  </p>
		
		  <p>
		      For my senior thesis at the College of William and Mary, I modeled a selection-migration balance in populations of birds in mercury-contaminated habitat. I then implemented this model, using simulations to determine which demographic and spatial processes were most influential in the fixation of a tolerance allele or migration load occurring in contaminated and uncontaminated populations. I worked on this project with <a href="https://www.people.wm.edu/~mdlama/">M. Drew Lamar</a>. <a href="https://publish.wm.edu/honorstheses/188/">Read more about this project here.</a>
